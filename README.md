Setup Threat Stack <-> AWS integration module

This module provides the ability to setup Threat Stack integration via Terraform.  This module will setup the following:

* AWS CloudTrail
  * multi-region trail
  * records global service events
  * S3 bucket to store events
    * enables log file validation
  * CloudTrail to Cloudwatch logging
* AWS SNS topic to forward CloudTrail events to
* AWS SQS queue Threat Stack will check for events
* Cross account IAM role for Threat Stack


## Usage
To use this module you need to create a Terraform configuration that utilizes this module.  A basic example configuration would look as follows (Be sure to adjust the git ref in the source value appropriately):

```hcl
module "threatstack_aws_integration" {
  source                        = "github.com/threatstack/tf_threatstack_aws_integration?ref=v1.0.0"
  aws_account                   = "<AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME>"
  aws_account_id                = "<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>"
  aws_region                    = "us-east-1"
  threatstack_account_id        = "<THREATSTACK_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>"
  threatstack_external_id       = "<THREATSTACK_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID>"
}
```

## Threat Stack Setup
In Threat Stack click `Add Profile` under _AWS Profiles_ fill in the relevant output values on the _Integrations_ page under _Settings_ and get the Threat Stack _Account ID_ and _External ID_.  Use these values for the `threatstack_account_id` and `threatstack_external_id`.  Run Terraform and get the outputs from it.

![Terraform output](https://github.com/threatstack/tf_threatstack_aws_integration/raw/master/doc/terraform_output.png "Terraform output")

With the output values, fill in the Threat Stack profile screen.

## Variables
* ___aws_account:___ Name of AWS account.  Used to find remote state information and is prepended to bucket names.

* ___aws_account_id:___ Account ID, used for CloudTrail integration.

* ___aws_region:___ AWS region.  Used to find remote state.

* ___aws_cloudtrail_name (optional):___ Name of CloudTrail trail.

* ___aws_iam_role_name (optional):___ Name of cross account IAM role grating access for Threat Stack to AWS environment.

* ___aws_sns_topic_name (optional):___ Name of SNS topic used by CloudTrail.

* ___aws_sns_topic_display_name (optional):___ SNS topic display name.

* ___aws_sqs_queue_name (optional):___ Name of SQS queue to forward events to.

* ___s3_bucket_name (optional):___ Name of bucket to create to store logs.  Pay attention to the fact that domain name and account name will be prepended to thebucket to help prevent name collisions.

* ___s3_bucket_prefix (optional):___ S3 prefix path for logs.  Useful is using a bucket used by other services. (Not recommended)

* ___s3_force_destroy (optional):___ Bucket destroy will fail if the bucket is not empty.  Set to `"true"` if you REALLY want to destroy logs on teardown.

* ___enable_logging (optional):___ Enable logging, set to 'false' to pause logging.

* ___enable_log_file_validation (optional):___ Create signed digest file to validated contents of logs.

* ___include_global_service_events (optional):___ Include evnets from global services such as IAM.

* ___is_multi_region_trail (optional):___ Whether the trail is created in all regions or just the current region.
